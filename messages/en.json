    "schoolDescription": "Salsa Rayo dance school was born from a shared dream. Konstantinos and Anna met in 2018, as teenagers with a passion for dance and the desire to create something of their own.\n\nStarting as a dance couple, they traveled to many festivals around the world, from Europe to New York. They also participated in Salsa competitions, where they won awards and distinctions, both in duets and group performances. With a strong stage presence and unique chemistry, Konstantinos and Anna evolved into a dynamic duo that authentically conveys their love for dance, both to students and audiences.\n\nIn 2025, the dream becomes reality. Salsa Rayo opens its doors in Agios Dimitrios, as a space where teaching meets passion and technique combines with inspiration.\n\nThe name Rayo, which means lightning in Spanish, was not chosen by chance. It represents strength, speed, and energy - elements that characterize both their style and the school's philosophy. Their goal is to share their knowledge and experience, inspire new dancers, and transmit the culture of Salsa and Bachata in a space full of creativity and respect for the art of dance.",
