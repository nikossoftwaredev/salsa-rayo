    "schoolDescription": "Salsa Rayo dance school was born from a shared dream. Konstantinos and Anna met in 2018, as teenagers with a passion for dance and the desire to create something of their own.\n\nStarting as a dance couple, they traveled to many festivals around the world, from Europe to New York. They also participated in Salsa competitions, where they won awards and distinctions, both in duets and group performances. With a strong stage presence and unique chemistry, Konstantinos and Anna evolved into a dynamic duo that authentically conveys their love for dance, both to students and audiences.\n\nIn 2025, the dream becomes reality. Salsa Rayo opens its doors in Agios Dimitrios, as a space where teaching meets passion and technique combines with inspiration.\n\nThe name Rayo, which means lightning in Spanish, was not chosen by chance. It represents strength, speed, and energy - elements that characterize both their style and the school's philosophy. Their goal is to share their knowledge and experience, inspire new dancers, and transmit the culture of Salsa and Bachata in a space full of creativity and respect for the art of dance.",

    "annaDescription": "I started dancing at the age of 6, with modern dance as my primary training. Since 2016, I have dedicated myself to Salsa and Bachata, two dances that deeply express me and have led me to evolve both as a dancer and as a teacher.\n\nBy frequently traveling and attending classes and workshops from renowned teachers in Greece and abroad, I continuously enrich my knowledge and influences, elements that are reflected both in my technique and the energy I bring to my classes. Additionally, I love choreographing and being on stage, conveying through movement my passion and vitality for dance.\n\nMy teaching combines positive energy with strict technical guidance, emphasizing proper foundation and personal expression. My special love is for \"Movement and Styling\" classes that cultivate confidence, approaching solo style in a more authentic and personalized way.",

    "konstantinosDescription": "I am a dance teacher specializing in Salsa, a dance full of vitality, passion, and explosiveness. My relationship with dance began at a very young age, but my introduction to Salsa started at 16, when I discovered it in my small town. I discovered the magic not only of rhythm and movement, but also the way it can be taught, with enthusiasm, laughter, and respect for each student.\n\nIn my journey so far, I have had the opportunity to travel to various countries and learn from the best salsa teachers in the world. This experience has helped me evolve and convey to my students technique, style, and the passion that makes dance truly come alive.\n\nAt our school, I ensure that from the first lesson, a warm and friendly environment is created so that students feel comfortable. At the same time, I want them to have the opportunity to evolve further and reach the next level, maintaining a professional character in the advanced classes.",
